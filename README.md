#HOW TO USE GITHUB/GIT
1. Create a new repository in "New Repository" from the + sign dropdown menu.
2. Install Git in order to create and add files and open it.
3. Add a new file to the repository by using "git add README.md".
4. Commit the file to the repo by using [git commit -m "adding readme".
5. Push the changes by using "git push origin [repository name]".
6. Create a pull request from this branch on github.com.
7. Creat any files to be added to the repository.
8. Re-add, commit and push the new files using steps 3-5 substituting "readme" with the file name/extension.
9. Merge the pull request on GitHub!
**Git is similar to CLIs functionality-wise!

#HOW TO USE WEBSTORM
1. Open a folder in WebStorm to store your code.
2. Click "Creat New Project".
3. To create a new file in your project, select the folder and press Alt+Insert.
4. Get to coding!
5. To run your file and test it, choose "Run [filename]" on the menu. WebStorm will open it in a browser.
**Due to familiarity, I will personally be using VSCode instead of WebStorm.
